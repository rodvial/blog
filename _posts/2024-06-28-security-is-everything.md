or the past few weeks, I have been getting lots of questions regarding security‚Ä¶ this is something we are getting more and more into, either we like it or not.

As a Technical Account Manager at Ntirety, one of my task was to make sure we let our customers know the advantages of getting secure instances in place rather than just what ever is easier.  The most complex scenario out there is to have everything secured vs to something very easily to implement but then suddenly we have all these threats and vulnerabilities in place (not to mention some Australian companies, you know who you are)

so lets talk about security‚Ä¶. should we‚Ä¶

Working at this cool enterprise called Ntirety, the most trusted comprehensive IT security provider, which was named 20th in the MSSP Alert Top 250 MSSPs ‚Äì 2022 Edition.

The list recognizes Ntirety as leading in business growth, ecosystem partnerships, quality of services, and superior talent.

The list and research identify and honor the top MSSPs (managed security service providers) worldwide. The rankings are based on MSSP Alert‚Äôs 2022 readership survey combined with the site‚Äôs editorial coverage of MSSP, MDR and MSP security providers. The sixth-annual list and research track the MSSP market‚Äôs ongoing growth and evolution.

‚ÄúMSSP Alert congratulates Ntirety on this year‚Äôs honor. The MSSP Alert readership and Top 250 honorees continue to outpace the cybersecurity market worldwide.‚Äù ‚Äì Joe Panettieri, editorial director of MSSP Alert, a CyberRisk Alliance resource

We have seen numerous places where we have compliant Security for example Hewlett Packard Enterprise ‚Äì securing data, also DRATA automating and accelerating compliance ?

so many websites, organizations doing the samething and answering the most common question‚Ä¶ how do we state our cybersecurity to your business ‚Äì

According to The State of Cybersecurity: 2023 Trends Report ‚Äì Security compliance management is one of the hottest topic in the market as of today‚Ä¶. and we should all need to discuss it at any point of our career, not for the sake of you but for the sake of your customers.
