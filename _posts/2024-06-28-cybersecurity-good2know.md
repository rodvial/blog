<h2>Cybersecurity is the practice of ensuring:</h2> Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information are ensured through the effective practice of security. This involves protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

Common cybersecurity terminology
Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
An internal threat can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
Network security is the practice of keeping an organization’s network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.
Cloud security is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)

Reviewing web traffic 

Alerting suspicious activity

## Phishing
Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

- Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

- Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

- Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

## Malware
Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

- Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

- Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

- Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access. 

- Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Social Engineering
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

- Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

- USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

- Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Social engineering principles 
Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people’s data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 

- Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

- Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 

- Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

- Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  

- Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

- Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

## Security Domains
Security domains are a way of categorizing and organizing different aspects of security within a system or organization. These domains help in understanding and managing security risks comprehensively. While the exact categorization may vary depending on the framework or methodology being used, some common security domains include:

1. Physical Security: This domain focuses on protecting physical assets, such as buildings, hardware, and other tangible items, from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or destruction. Measures may include locks, fences, security guards, surveillance cameras, and access control systems.

2. Network Security: Network security involves safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources transmitted over networks. This domain includes measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), encryption, virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure configurations of network devices.

3. Application Security: Application security focuses on securing software applications and the data they process. This includes identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in code, implementing secure coding practices, conducting regular security testing (such as penetration testing and code reviews), and ensuring secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

4. Information Security: Information security encompasses the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This domain involves implementing policies, procedures, and technologies to classify, handle, and safeguard data appropriately. Measures may include access controls, encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), and incident response plans.

5. Operational Security (OPSEC): Operational security involves protecting critical information related to an organization’s operations, plans, and capabilities. This domain focuses on minimizing the risk of information disclosure that could be exploited by adversaries to compromise security. Measures may include limiting access to sensitive information on a need-to-know basis, controlling communication channels, and maintaining situational awareness.

6. Personnel Security: Personnel security addresses the human element of security, ensuring that individuals with access to sensitive information or critical assets are trustworthy and adequately trained. This domain involves conducting background checks, providing security awareness training, enforcing security policies and procedures, and managing access privileges based on roles and responsibilities.

7. Risk Management: Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing security risks to the organization and implementing controls to mitigate or manage these risks effectively. This domain includes activities such as risk assessments, vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident response planning.

By categorizing security concerns into these domains, organizations can develop a holistic approach to security that addresses various threats and vulnerabilities across different areas of their operations.

## Determine the type of attack
Attack types:
Password attack - A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

Brute force

Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

Social engineering attack - Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

- Phishing

- Smishing

- Vishing

- Spear phishing

- Whaling

- Social media phishing

- Business Email Compromise (BEC)

- Watering hole attack

- USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting

- Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

Physical attack: A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- Malicious USB cable

- Malicious flash drive

- Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

Adversarial artificial intelligence
Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

Supply-chain attack
A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

Cryptographic attack
A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- Birthday

- Collision

- Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

## Understand attackers
Threat actor types
Advanced persistent threats
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization’s network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

Insider threats: Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

- Sabotage

- Corruption

- Espionage

- Unauthorized data access or leaks 

Hacktivists: Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

- Demonstrations

- Propaganda

- Social change campaigns

- Fame

Hacker types: A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.

- Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

- Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

Note: There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

- To learn and enhance their hacking skills

- To seek revenge

- To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

## Security frameworks and controls
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. 
 
Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle.
 
The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.
 
There are several security frameworks that may be used to manage  different types of organizational  and regulatory compliance risks. 
The purpose of security frameworks include protecting  personally identifiable information, known as PII,  securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals.
Frameworks have four core components and understanding them will allow you to better manage potential risks. 

The first core component is identifying and documenting security goals. 
For example, an organization may have a goal to align with the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR. 
GDPR is a data protection law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data. 
A security analyst may be asked to identify and document areas where an organization is out of compliance with GDPR.
The second core component is setting guidelines to achieve security goals. 

For example, when implementing guidelines to achieve GDPR compliance, your organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users.
The third core component of security frameworks is implementing strong security processes.

In the case of GDPR, a security analyst working for a social media company may help design procedures to ensure the organization complies with verified user data requests. 

An example of this type of request is when a user attempts to update or delete their profile information.
The last core component of security frameworks is monitoring and communicating results. 

As an example, you may monitor your organization’s internal network and report a potential security issue affecting GDPR to your manager or regulatory compliance officer.
Now that we’ve introduced the four core components of security frameworks, let’s tie them all together. 

Frameworks allow analysts to work alongside other members of the security team to document, implement, and use the policies and procedures that have been created. 
It’s essential for an entry-level analyst to understand this process because it directly affects the work they do and how they collaborate with others. 
Next, we’ll discuss security controls.
 
Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 

For example, your company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to  reduce the risk of data breaches. 
 
As a security analyst, you may use a software tool to automatically assign and track which employees have completed this training.
Security frameworks and controls are vital to managing security for all types of organizations and ensuring that everyone is doing their part to maintain a low level of risk.

Understanding their purpose and how they are used allows analysts to support an organization’s security goals and protect the people it serves.

## Security Frameworks and Controls
The CIA triad is a foundational model in information security used to guide policies for information security within an organization. CIA stands for:

Confidentiality: This refers to ensuring that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to access it. It involves protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, whether intentional or accidental.

Integrity: Integrity ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. It involves protecting data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals or processes. Maintaining data integrity is crucial for ensuring its reliability and usability.

Availability: Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. It involves implementing measures to prevent or minimize disruptions to access, such as through system failures, attacks, or natural disasters.

These three principles form the basis of a comprehensive approach to information security, guiding organizations in implementing appropriate controls and measures to protect their assets and mitigate risks.

The CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
 
Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
For example, strict access controls that define who should and should not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe.
Integrity means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
To maintain integrity, security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption
to safeguard data from being tampered with.
Availability means data is
accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
 
asset.
An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
And value is determined by the cost
associated with the asset in question.
 
For example, an application that stores sensitive data, such as social security numbers or bank accounts, is a valuable asset to an organization.
It carries more risk and therefore requires tighter security controls in comparison to a website that shares publicly available news content.
As you may remember, earlier in the course, we discussed frameworks and controls in general.
Now, we’ll discuss a specific framework developed by the U.S.-based National Institute of Standards and Technology:
the Cybersecurity Framework, also referred to as the NIST CSF.
 
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
 
It’s important to become familiar with this framework because security teams use it as a baseline to manage short and long term risk.
Managing and mitigating risks and protecting an organization’s assets from threat actors are key goals for security professionals.
Understanding the different motives a threat actor may have, alongside identifying your organization’s most valuable assets is important.
Some of the most dangerous threat actors to consider are disgruntled employees.
They are the most dangerous because they often have access to sensitive information and know where to find it.
In order to reduce this type of risk, security professionals would use the principle of availability, as well as organizational guidelines
based on frameworks to ensure staff members can only access the data they need to perform their jobs.
 
Threat actors originate from all across the globe, and a diverse workforce of security professionals helps organizations identify attackers’ intentions.
A variety of perspectives can assist organizations in understanding and mitigating the impact of malicious activity.  That concludes our introduction to
the CIA triad and NIST CSF framework, which are used to develop processes to secure organizations and the people they serve.

## Controls, frameworks, and compliance
How controls, frameworks, and compliance are related
The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. 


CIA are the three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

As you may recall, security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

Identifying and documenting security goals 

Setting guidelines to achieve security goals 

Implementing strong security processes

Monitoring and communicating results

Some of the primary purposes of security frameworks include:

Identifying security weaknesses: Security frameworks help organizations identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their security posture by providing guidelines for assessing and improving security controls and practices.

Securing financial information: Security frameworks offer guidelines and best practices for protecting sensitive financial information, such as payment card data, financial transactions, and other financial assets, from unauthorized access, disclosure, or theft.

Aligning security with business goals: Security frameworks help organizations align their security initiatives and practices with their overall business objectives and priorities. By integrating security into business processes and strategies, organizations can effectively mitigate risks and support their broader business goals.

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

Specific controls, frameworks, and compliance
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk. The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.

Examples of frameworks include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). 

Note: Specifications and guidelines can change depending on the type of organization you work for.

In addition to the NIST CSF

and NIST RMF

, there are several other controls, frameworks, and compliance standards that are important for security professionals to be familiar with to help keep organizations and the people they serve safe.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission – North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)
FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC. 

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)
FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

Center for Internet Security (CIS®)
CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients’ health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 

Privacy

Security 

Breach notification 

Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients’ Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services. 

System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization’s user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

Associate

Supervisor

Manager

Executive

Vendor

Others 

They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

Pro tip: There are a number of regulations that are frequently revised. You are encouraged to keep up-to-date with changes and explore more frameworks, controls, and compliance. Two suggestions to research: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

United States Presidential Executive Order 14028
On May 12, 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity. Remediation efforts are directed toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to U.S. critical infrastructure

. For additional information, review the Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.
