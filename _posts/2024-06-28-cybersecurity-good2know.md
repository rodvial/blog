<h2>Cybersecurity is the practice of ensuring:</h2> Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information are ensured through the effective practice of security. This involves protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

Common cybersecurity terminology
Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
An internal threat can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
Network security is the practice of keeping an organization’s network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.
Cloud security is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)

Reviewing web traffic 

Alerting suspicious activity

## Phishing
Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

- Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

- Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

- Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

## Malware
Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

- Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

- Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

- Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access. 

- Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Social Engineering
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

- Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

- USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

- Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Social engineering principles 
Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people’s data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 

- Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

- Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 

- Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

- Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  

- Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

- Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

## Security Domains
Security domains are a way of categorizing and organizing different aspects of security within a system or organization. These domains help in understanding and managing security risks comprehensively. While the exact categorization may vary depending on the framework or methodology being used, some common security domains include:

1. Physical Security: This domain focuses on protecting physical assets, such as buildings, hardware, and other tangible items, from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or destruction. Measures may include locks, fences, security guards, surveillance cameras, and access control systems.

2. Network Security: Network security involves safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources transmitted over networks. This domain includes measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), encryption, virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure configurations of network devices.

3. Application Security: Application security focuses on securing software applications and the data they process. This includes identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in code, implementing secure coding practices, conducting regular security testing (such as penetration testing and code reviews), and ensuring secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

4. Information Security: Information security encompasses the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This domain involves implementing policies, procedures, and technologies to classify, handle, and safeguard data appropriately. Measures may include access controls, encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), and incident response plans.

5. Operational Security (OPSEC): Operational security involves protecting critical information related to an organization’s operations, plans, and capabilities. This domain focuses on minimizing the risk of information disclosure that could be exploited by adversaries to compromise security. Measures may include limiting access to sensitive information on a need-to-know basis, controlling communication channels, and maintaining situational awareness.

6. Personnel Security: Personnel security addresses the human element of security, ensuring that individuals with access to sensitive information or critical assets are trustworthy and adequately trained. This domain involves conducting background checks, providing security awareness training, enforcing security policies and procedures, and managing access privileges based on roles and responsibilities.

7. Risk Management: Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing security risks to the organization and implementing controls to mitigate or manage these risks effectively. This domain includes activities such as risk assessments, vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident response planning.

By categorizing security concerns into these domains, organizations can develop a holistic approach to security that addresses various threats and vulnerabilities across different areas of their operations.
